This folder contains the standard for the Coding Guidelines for FLOW3. There are no sniffs but a ruleset.xml file in it.
In this file we refer to the needed sniffs for the specified standard.
So we take some shipped sniffs from PHP_CodeSniffer and our own ones from TYPO3 folder.

To use this standard you have to type "phpcs --standard=FLOW3 /path/to/file" in your terminal.

For further informations please have a look at:
